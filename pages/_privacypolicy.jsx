      <ul>
        <li>
          Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data

          us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good
          reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask

        <li>
          Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying
          on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
          something about your particular situation which makes you want to
          object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object
          where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing
          purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Request the restriction of processing of your personal information.
          This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal
          information about you, for example if you want us to establish its
          accuracy or the reason for processing it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        What we may need from you: We may need to request specific information
        from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
        access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. This
        is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to
        any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to
